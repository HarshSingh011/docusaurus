Hello, my name is Harsh Singh currently I am in the probation period of the SI Department. I am a hardworking person but my weakness is that I
can't say no to people and many more but I can't discuss them openly. I am currently working on my weakness I am trying to improve
myself the main motive of my Btech is to make myself better in life so that I can become a better person than I was yesterday.

My skill sets are:-

HTML, CSS, and JS: I have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS but I think my JS is not that refined but I am working on it to improve my
 JS part.

C and C++: I have a basic understanding of programming as I am currently working on my DSA part but I lack practice.

NODE and Express: I am also learning backend as my SIH team lacks a backend developer so I am currently learning backend.

Here are my learning and Tasks that I have learned in SI.

                                                          ### TASK 1

The task 1 was about the Github repository. I use to push my project through drag and drop prcedure in gitHub but now I am really out of that 
process of pushing things using drag and drop process.

                                                          ### TASK 2

*Description* :- Make a Protfolio using HTML CSS only

*Process of Making*:- My previous project before this were not so much focused on UI/UX or designing so it was very difficult
for me to play with colour, fonts and animation but in that process I learn to apply animation through CSS but as I said my desining was not that
good so I first design the portolio  and It look like this:

and then after increasing of deadline I decide to change my design and make it look more profesional and better from my designing point of view.

   change your design in probation in such a short period of time.

                                                         ### TASK 3
