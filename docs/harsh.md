Hello, my name is Harsh Singh currently I am in the probation period of the SI Department. I am a hardworking person but my weakness is that I
can't say no to people and many more but I can't discuss them openly. I am currently working on my weakness I am trying to improve
myself the main motive of my Btech is to make myself better in life so that I can become a better person than I was yesterday.

My skill sets are:-

HTML, CSS, and JS: I have a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS but I think my JS is not that refined but I am working on it to improve my
 JS part.

C and C++: I have a basic understanding of programming as I am currently working on my DSA part but I lack practice.

NODE and Express: I am also learning backend as my SIH team lacks a backend developer so I am currently learning backend.

Here are my learning and Tasks that I have learned in SI.

                                                          ### TASK 1

The task 1 was about the Github repository. I use to push my project through drag and drop prcedure in gitHub but now I am really out of that 
process of pushing things using drag and drop process.

                                                          ### TASK 2

*Description* :- Make a Protfolio using HTML CSS only

*Process of Making*:- My previous project before this were not so much focused on UI/UX or designing so it was very difficult
for me to play with colour, fonts and animation but in that process I learn to apply animation through CSS but as I said my desining was not that
good so I first design the portolio  and It look like this:

and then after increasing of deadline I decide to change my design and make it look more profesional and better from my designing point of view.

*Learning* :- 
1. I learnd about animatin in CSS and I applied it on my project also.
2. I also learned about designing that senior mention in my project like how UI/UX really works.
3. I first design was responsive but after changing my desing I didn't get the time make it fully responsive so lakshay sir gave he tip to never
   change your design in probation in such a short period of time.

                                                         ### TASK 3

*Description* :- Animation task using JavaScript

*Process of Making* :- This Project was really special for me cause it was my own idea of making a survial game my showing animation of balls
                       representing wolf and sheep and it really paid of cause senior also like my idea I also take review from senior a day before
                       submission like Rachit sir told me to make animation more smooth using requestAnimationFrame before that I was using 
                       setTimeInteval and it was my first project with no bugs and with awesome presentation.

*Github Repository*:- https://github.com/HarshSingh011/Animate_Game.git

*Hosted Link*:- https://animationgame1300.netlify.app/

*Learning* :- 
1. First thing I learned from this project was animation through JS.
2. Second thing was canvas and it useage.
3. Third thing was practical application of physics in this project I practically appied the collision detection of two balls.


                                                        ### Task 4

*Description* :- Game task using JavaScript 

*Process of Making* :- This was a group task me and Mayank were working as a team to built a game based on Need For Speed 1994 but at the start
                       it was really difficult cause we were trying to make our projrct 3D but it didn't go well so we decided to change the idea 
                       from 3D to 2D but only 2 days were left so we made game not like nfs but much like a car dodging obstacle and there were bugs
                       in this game but when we got a night to fix our bugs we fixed all those bugs and a added a story in the game and opponents 
                       to make it feel more like nfs.

                       The 4th year enjoyed the game and they like the idea of making story in the game but they said that the difficulty of game 
                       is high it should be a bit low.

*Github Repository*:- 

Hosted Link*:- 

*Learning*:-
1. I learned about spikes as I have not have worked with it.
2. I learned about how practical knowledge, formula, physics and matemtical ratios are used in programming as in our project it is all about ratios.
3. I also learned to manage my time according to the need as this project really taught me this skill.

                                                      ### Domain( Android Development)

About:- I have no experience in app development and I have learned webdevelopment till now so switching from web to app is really risky for me 
        cause I have been thinking that would I would not be able to survive the probation cause switching in probation is bit ricky from my point
        of view but I am taking it cause after taking suggestion from senior and gathering information from internet I think fluter was good 
        option for me as it has more opportunity in internship but in meet with 4th year I changed my tect stack from fluter to android cause 
        4th year told me that android have more opportunity in market then fluter and I should focus on what market need not on what I want to do.

                                                      ### Task 1

*Description*:- Making a Design

*Process of Making*:- It was a easly task but at start it was really confusing and frustrating like what attributes to use and becoming familier
                      with the xml files codes was difficult at the start.
